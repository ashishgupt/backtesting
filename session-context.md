## 📊 RESEARCH INSIGHTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### 🔬 **Asset Selection Research:**
Based on correlation analysis and performance research:
- **REITs (VNQ)**: Low correlation with stocks (0.12 with BND), inflation hedge
- **Gold (GLD)**: Negative correlation during crises, flight-to-safety asset
- **Emerging Markets (VWO)**: Lower correlation with US (trending down since 2000)
- **Technology (QQQ)**: 445% 10-year return vs S&P 500's 260%

### 📈 **Market Insights:**
- Average investor gets 2.9% returns while market delivers 10%
- Poor allocation costs $23,000 on $50k over 10 years
- Correlations increasing globally but emerging markets still provide diversification
- 20-year data includes multiple crisis periods for robust testing

### 🎯 **User Psychology Research:**
- Users don't want to read - need progressive disclosure
- Trust built through transparency and institutional-grade accuracy
- Problem-first narrative more effective than feature-first
- Concrete dollar amounts more compelling than abstract percentages

### 🤖 **Conversational Rebalancing Insights:**
- **Tax Efficiency**: Primary concern for sophisticated investors in taxable accounts
- **Strategy Comparison**: Users want evidence-based recommendations (monthly vs quarterly vs threshold)
- **Crisis Analysis**: Rebalancing during crashes reduces recovery time by 20-30%
- **Personalization**: Account type (taxable/401k), timeline, and tax bracket affect optimal strategy
- **Threshold Research**: 5-10% drift tolerance often performs as well as monthly with lower costs
