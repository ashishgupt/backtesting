**✅ Status**: **COMPLETE** - All objectives achieved and tested  
**🚀 Result**: Production-ready rebalancing analysis system with honest cost attribution

---

## 🏆 ACHIEVEMENT SUMMARY

### **✅ CORE OBJECTIVES COMPLETED**

#### **1. Four Rebalancing Methods Implemented** ✅
- **5% Threshold Rebalancing**: Rebalance when any asset drifts >5% from target
- **10% Threshold Rebalancing**: Rebalance when any asset drifts >10% from target  
- **Quarterly Rebalancing**: Rebalance every 3 months on schedule
- **Annual Rebalancing**: Rebalance once per year on schedule
- **New Money Only**: Tax-efficient rebalancing using contributions only

#### **2. Tax-Aware Rebalancing Analysis** ✅
- **Taxable Account Intelligence**: Calculates capital gains tax impact
- **Tax-Deferred Accounts**: Lower transaction costs, no tax implications
- **Tax-Free Accounts**: Optimal for active rebalancing strategies
- **New Money Strategy**: Eliminates tax drag completely in taxable accounts

#### **3. Walk-Forward Performance Analysis** ✅
- **Historical Testing**: 2014-2024 comprehensive backtesting
- **Real Transaction Costs**: 3-5 basis points per trade accurately modeled
- **Tax Drag Calculations**: Short-term vs long-term capital gains rates
- **Performance Attribution**: Separates strategy returns from cost impacts

#### **4. Strategy Recommendation Engine** ✅
- **Multi-Criteria Scoring**: Returns, costs, risk-adjusted performance
- **Account-Type Aware**: Different recommendations by account type
- **Intelligent Explanations**: Clear reasoning for each recommendation
- **Cost Efficiency Analysis**: Active return per dollar of costs incurred
