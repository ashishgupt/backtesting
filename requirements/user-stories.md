# User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

## Epic 1: Core Backtesting Engine

### Story 1.1: Historical Data Ingestion
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** to store 10 years of daily price data for VTI, VTIAX, and BND  
**So that** backtesting calculations have accurate historical data  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Daily price data from 2015-2025 stored in database
- [ ] Includes adjusted close prices accounting for dividends and splits
- [ ] Data validation ensures no missing dates or incorrect values
- [ ] API endpoint to refresh/update data from external sources

### Story 1.2: Portfolio Performance Calculation
**As a** sophisticated investor

**So that** I can evaluate historical risk and return characteristics  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Calculate total return assuming daily rebalancing
- [ ] Handle dividend reinvestment correctly
- [ ] Account for transaction costs (configurable parameter)
- [ ] Return key metrics: CAGR, volatility, max drawdown, best/worst year
- [ ] Results match industry-standard calculations (within 0.1% tolerance)

### Story 1.3: Risk Metrics Calculation
**As a** risk-conscious investor  
**I want** to understand drawdown periods and recovery times  
**So that** I can assess if a portfolio fits my risk tolerance and timeline  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Calculate maximum drawdown and date it occurred
- [ ] Identify underwater periods (time below previous peak)
- [ ] Calculate recovery time from major drawdowns
- [ ] Show drawdown distribution (frequency of different drawdown levels)
- [ ] Sharpe and Sortino ratios for risk-adjusted returns

## Epic 2: Portfolio Optimization

### Story 2.1: Efficient Frontier Generation
**As a** data-driven investor  
**I want** to see the efficient frontier for the 3-asset portfolio  
**So that** I can understand optimal risk/return trade-offs  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Generate 50+ portfolio points along efficient frontier
- [ ] Calculate expected return and volatility for each point
- [ ] Identify minimum variance portfolio
- [ ] Identify maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio
- [ ] API endpoint returns efficient frontier data as JSON

### Story 2.2: Constrained Optimization
**As a** conservative investor with specific constraints  
**I want** to find optimal allocation within my risk limits  
**So that** I get maximum return without exceeding my drawdown tolerance  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Accept constraints: max drawdown, min/max allocation per asset
- [ ] Find portfolio with highest expected return within constraints
- [ ] Validate constraints are actually met in backtesting
- [ ] Return confidence intervals for expected performance
- [ ] Handle infeasible constraint combinations gracefully

## Epic 3: Rebalancing Analysis

### Story 3.1: Current Portfolio Assessment
**As an** investor with existing holdings  
**I want** to input my current allocation and see how it compares to optimal  
**So that** I can decide if rebalancing is worthwhile  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Accept current portfolio allocation as input
- [ ] Calculate performance gap vs optimal allocation
- [ ] Show historical performance comparison
- [ ] Estimate future expected return difference
- [ ] Factor in rebalancing costs

### Story 3.2: Tax-Efficient Rebalancing
**As a** taxable account investor  
**I want** to understand tax implications of rebalancing moves  
**So that** I can make tax-efficient portfolio adjustments  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Calculate capital gains/losses for proposed changes
- [ ] Consider tax-loss harvesting opportunities
- [ ] Suggest gradual rebalancing to minimize tax impact
- [ ] Account for different tax rates (short-term vs long-term gains)
- [ ] Provide after-tax performance projections

## Epic 4: API & Integration Foundation

### Story 4.1: Mathematical Calculation APIs
**As a** future chatbot integration  
**I want** modular API endpoints for all calculations  
**So that** Claude can access specific financial metrics on demand  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `/api/backtest` - Full portfolio backtesting
- [ ] `/api/metrics/sharpe` - Sharpe ratio calculation
- [ ] `/api/metrics/drawdown` - Drawdown analysis
- [ ] `/api/optimize/efficient-frontier` - Optimization calculations
- [ ] `/api/rebalance/analysis` - Rebalancing recommendations
- [ ] All endpoints return JSON with consistent error handling
- [ ] API documentation with example requests/responses

### Story 4.2: Claude Function Integration
**As a** user wanting AI-powered recommendations  
**I want** Claude to access portfolio calculations through function calls  
**So that** I can get personalized advice through natural conversation  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Claude can call backtesting APIs as functions
- [ ] Function responses include all necessary context for recommendations
- [ ] Claude can chain multiple calculations for complex analysis
- [ ] Error handling provides useful feedback to Claude
- [ ] Function calls complete within reasonable time limits (<10 seconds)
