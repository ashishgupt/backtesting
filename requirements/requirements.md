# Portfolio Backtesting PoC - Requirements Document

## Product Vision
An AI-powered portfolio optimization system for sophisticated individual investors who want data-driven asset allocation decisions based on backtested performance rather than generic risk questionnaires.

## Target User Profile
- **Primary**: Individual sophisticated investors (intermediate to advanced)
- **Financial Knowledge**: Understands realistic market returns, long-term investing principles
- **Current Challenge**: Has existing investments, needs to compare allocation strategies before rebalancing
- **Tax Consideration**: Wants to avoid unnecessary tax triggers in taxable accounts during rebalancing
- **Secondary Goal**: Convert benchmark-only investors (S&P 500) to diversified portfolio approach

## Business Objectives

### Immediate Goals (PoC Phase)
1. **Technical Validation**: Prove backtesting algorithms produce accurate historical performance data
2. **Optimization Engine**: Generate optimal portfolio allocations using efficient frontier
3. **Core Asset Universe**: Focus on 3-asset portfolio (VTI, VTIAX, BND)
4. **Performance Metrics**: Calculate key statistics (returns, drawdown, recovery time, etc.)

### Next Phase Goals
1. **User Interface**: Clean, intuitive portfolio comparison interface
2. **AI Integration**: Claude-powered chatbot for portfolio recommendations
3. **Rebalancing Logic**: Tax-efficient rebalancing strategies for taxable accounts

### Future Expansion
1. **Asset Universe**: Add more indexes (small-cap, emerging markets, REITs, sector ETFs)
2. **Historical Depth**: Extend from 10 years to 20+ years of data
3. **Advanced Features**: Monte Carlo simulations, goal-based planning

## Technical Specifications

### Data Requirements
- **Time Period**: 10 years of historical data (2015-2025)
- **Frequency**: Daily price data
- **Data Points**: Price, dividends, splits for accurate total return calculations
- **Initial Assets**: 
  - VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF)
  - VTIAX (Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund)
  - BND (Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF)

### Core Features (Priority Order)

#### 1. Algorithm Accuracy & Optimization (Immediate)
- **Backtesting Engine**: Calculate portfolio performance with daily rebalancing
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Annualized returns (1, 5, 10 years)
  - Best/worst year performance
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Underwater periods and recovery time
  - Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio
  - Volatility (standard deviation)
- **Efficient Frontier**: Calculate optimal risk/return combinations
- **Constraint-based Optimization**: Find best allocation within risk tolerance

#### 2. User Experience & Chat Interface (Next Phase)
- **Portfolio Comparison**: Side-by-side analysis of different allocations
- **Interactive Charts**: Historical performance visualization
- **Claude Integration**: Natural language portfolio recommendations
- **Tax Considerations**: Flag potential tax implications of rebalancing

#### 3. Data Depth & Expansion (Future)
- **Extended History**: 20+ years of backtesting data
- **More Assets**: Expand beyond core 3-asset portfolio
- **Advanced Analytics**: Monte Carlo projections, stress testing

## Success Metrics

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Backtesting results match industry-standard tools (within 0.1% margin)
- [ ] Optimization algorithms complete within 5 seconds for 3-asset portfolio
- [ ] Historical data accuracy verified against multiple sources

### User Value
- [ ] Can identify optimal allocation better than equal-weight portfolio
- [ ] Provides actionable rebalancing recommendations
- [ ] Tax-impact analysis prevents unnecessary trading costs

## Constraints & Assumptions
- **Development Time**: 4-6 weeks for PoC
- **Infrastructure**: Local development initially, cloud deployment later  
- **Data Sources**: Free/low-cost APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
- **Regulatory**: Educational tool only, not investment advice
