- [x] ORM models (SQLAlchemy)
- [x] Data ingestion (Yahoo Finance integration)
- [x] Portfolio backtesting engine
- [x] Performance metrics calculation
- [x] Validation against industry benchmarks

## Phase 2: FastAPI Web Layer - ✅ COMPLETED

### API Foundation
- [x] Create FastAPI application structure
- [x] Configure CORS and middleware
- [x] Add environment-based configuration
- [x] Implement error handling and logging
- [x] Add health check endpoint

### Core Backtesting API
- [x] POST /api/backtest/portfolio - Main backtesting endpoint
- [x] GET /api/portfolio/cached/{hash} - Retrieve cached results (integrated)
- [x] GET /api/data/prices/{symbol} - Get price data
- [x] POST /api/data/refresh - Refresh price data

### Data Management API
- [x] GET /api/assets - List available assets
- [x] GET /api/assets/{symbol}/info - Asset details
- [x] GET /api/data/status - Data health check

### Response Models & Validation
- [x] Create Pydantic models for requests/responses
- [x] Add input validation for portfolio allocations
- [x] Implement proper error response formats

### ✅ PHASE 2 RESULTS:
- **FastAPI server running** on port 8004
- **Backtesting endpoint working** - 0.36s response time
- **Database integration complete** - Assets and caching working
- **OpenAPI documentation** available at /docs
- **Performance**: Sub-second backtests for 10-year periods
- **Validation**: Proper error handling and input validation

## Phase 3: Portfolio Optimization - ✅ COMPLETED

### OptimizationEngine Class
- [x] OptimizationEngine class with scipy.optimize integration
- [x] Efficient frontier calculation using Modern Portfolio Theory
- [x] Maximum Sharpe ratio optimization
- [x] Constrained optimization with min/max allocation limits
- [x] Correlation matrix and expected returns calculation

### Optimization API Endpoints
- [x] POST /api/optimize/efficient-frontier - Generate optimal portfolios
- [x] POST /api/optimize/max-sharpe - Find maximum Sharpe ratio portfolio
- [x] Pydantic models for requests and responses
- [x] Comprehensive constraint support (min/max weights per asset)
- [x] NumPy type conversion for JSON serialization

### ✅ PHASE 3 RESULTS:
- **Max Sharpe Portfolio**: 100% VTIAX = 13.44% return, 17.99% volatility, 0.636 Sharpe
- **Efficient Frontier**: 20 portfolios generated in 0.10 seconds
- **Constrained Optimization**: 40% VTI, 50% VTIAX, 10% BND = 0.547 Sharpe  
- **Performance**: Sub-second optimization calculations
- **Integration**: Full database and backtesting integration

## Phase 4: Claude Integration - ✅ COMPLETED

### Natural Language Interface
- [x] ClaudePortfolioAdvisor class with natural language parsing
- [x] InvestorProfile classification (conservative/balanced/aggressive)
- [x] PortfolioRecommendation structured output with reasoning
- [x] Integration with backtesting and optimization engines

### Claude Chat API
- [x] POST /api/chat/recommend - Natural language portfolio recommendations
- [x] POST /api/chat/analyze - Portfolio analysis and Q&A
- [x] GET /api/chat/examples - Example queries for users
- [x] Pydantic models for chat requests/responses
- [x] Natural language parsing for risk tolerance, investment horizon, preferences

### ✅ PHASE 4 RESULTS:
- **Natural Language Processing**: Parses user requests like "I'm 35 and want balanced portfolio"
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: 85% confidence scores with detailed reasoning
- **Real Backtesting Integration**: Uses actual 10-year historical data for projections
- **Conversational Analysis**: Answers questions like "How risky is my portfolio?"
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times for chat interactions
- **Example Queries**: Built-in examples help users understand capabilities
- **🔧 BUG FIX**: Time horizon now properly affects allocations (3yr: 64% bonds, 30yr: 100% stocks)
- **🔧 BUG FIX**: Risk profile classification based on final allocation (70% bonds = Conservative, not Balanced)

## Phase 5: Production Readiness - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Complete API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger at /docs)
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] Performance optimization (sub-second response times)
- [x] Input validation and proper response formats
- [x] Docker containerization with multi-service setup
- [x] Load testing framework with concurrent user simulation
- [x] Claude chat UI with modern responsive design
- [x] Rate limiting implementation (Nginx)
- [x] Production deployment guide with security checklist

### ✅ PHASE 5 RESULTS:
- **Production Docker Setup**: Multi-container deployment with Nginx, FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- **Web UI**: Modern chat interface with real-time portfolio recommendations
- **Load Testing**: Comprehensive testing framework for performance validation
- **Security**: Rate limiting, CORS, input validation, secure database configuration
- **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide with troubleshooting and monitoring
- **Performance**: Target <2s for backtesting, <1s for chat responses
