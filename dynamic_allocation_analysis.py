Dynamic Rebalancing vs Dynamic Allocation Analysis

Investigate the difference between:
1. Dynamic rebalancing: Maintaining fixed target weights over time
2. Dynamic allocation: Changing target weights based on market conditions

Check what our system actually does and if it supports true dynamic allocation.
