- ✅ Recommendations and insights generated correctly
- ✅ Error handling works for invalid API responses
- ✅ Loading states and user feedback operational

## 📊 Expected User Experience After Fix

### Step 5: Rebalancing Strategy Optimization
When users reach Step 5 in the guided dashboard, they will now see:

1. **Loading Phase**: "Optimizing rebalancing strategies for your account type..."

2. **Results Display**:
   - **Best Strategy**: "5 Percent Threshold" (or whichever performs best)
   - **Annual Savings**: "$947" (cost efficiency metric)
   - **Optimal Frequency**: "Threshold-based" 
   - **Expected Alpha**: "+9.55%" (annualized return)

3. **Visualization**:
   - Bar chart comparing net returns across all 3 strategies
   - Clear visual indication of best performing strategy

4. **Recommendations**:
   - Personalized insights based on account type (taxable/tax-deferred/tax-free)
   - Specific guidance on rebalancing frequency and costs
   - Educational information about rebalancing benefits
